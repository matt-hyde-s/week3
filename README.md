# Week-3: APIs and Iteration

## **Goals**

This week, you will be learning how to pull in online datasets through the use of APIs, how to create your own functions, and how to iterate over a vector with `for` loops and `map()`. Next, you will learn how to explore data with munging, interactive plotting, and other tidying/organizing techniques. Lastly you will practice all of these skills on an entirely fresh data set. 

## **Assignment** 

There are three R Markdown lessons (01_api-funct-iter, 02_data_munging, 03_denouement) that must be completed by the due date. The videos highlight concepts found in each lesson as follows:

**01_api-funct-iter**: *Lesson 3.1.1 - APIs*; *Lesson 3.1.2 - Functions*; *Lesson 3.1.3 - Iterations*

**02_data_munging**: *Lesson 3.2 - Data Munging*

**03_denouement**: *Lesson 3.3 - Testing New Skills*

Fill out and submit all three .RMD assignments for peer review by the end of **Wednesday, 2/8**.

Happy coding! :-)
